# Privacy Policy for Sip MUD Client

**Effective Date: October 29, 2025**

## Introduction
Sip MUD Client ("Sip" or "the App") is a desktop application developed by Bo Zimmerman for connecting to Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. We do not collect or transmit any personal data to external servers unless explicitly part of your MUD interactions.

## Information We Collect
- **Optional User-Provided Data**: You may enter MUD account credentials (e.g., username and password) for auto-login features. This is entirely optional and user-initiated.
- **No Automatic Collection**: The App does not collect device information, usage analytics, or any other data without your input.
- **No Third-Party Data**: We do not integrate with advertising, analytics, or other services that track users.

## How We Use and Store Your Information
- **Local Storage Only**: Any entered credentials are stored locally on your device using Chromium's localStorage (via Electron). This data is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.
- **Transmission**: Credentials are only sent to the MUD server you connect to, as part of the login process. 
- **Security**: Data is stored in plain text locally (as per standard localStorage behavior). Users are responsible for securing their devices.
- **No Sharing or Selling**: We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to anyone.

## Your Rights and Choices
- **Access and Deletion**: You can view, edit, or delete stored data directly in the App or by clearing localStorage (e.g., via browser dev tools in Electron or deleting app data folders).
- **Opt-Out**: Simply avoid entering optional credentials if you prefer not to store them.
- **Children's Privacy**: The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from them.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be posted here with a revised effective date.
