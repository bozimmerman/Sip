<h3>Custom Media</h3>
Custom Media is a selection of audio and image files, such as mp3, jpeg, etc,
that are stored in the client for use by your custom <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a>, 
MSP, or or client-side customizations.
<P>
You can customize your media collection from the Global Options/Media menu.  
<P>
The Media Tree shows the root folder / and any other files or folders you've
added.  Folders will be blue, and normal files green.  You must select a file
or folder to use the other options.
<P>
The New Folder button requires a parent directory (blue node) to be selected
and highlighted.  It allows you to create a new folder inside that one.
<P>
The Upload button is how you contribute new media files to a folder, so it also
requires selecting a folder first.  A 100k limit is placed on files.
<P>
The Delete button allows you to remove the selected file or folder.  Selected
folders will remove all nodes inside them.
<P>
To use your custom media inside MXP or MSP, you must use the "media://" prefix,
followed by the path of the file.  For example, if you have the image file "merch.jpg"
inside folder "myimages", then the full url would be "media://myimages/merch.jpg."
