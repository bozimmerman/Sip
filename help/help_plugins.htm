<DIV ID="HELPROOT">
<h3>Plugins</h3>
An <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a> is a collection of
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Timers')">Timers</a>, 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Aliases')">Aliases,</a>,
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Triggers')">Triggers</a>,
and a special javascript Script that can receive and respond to special
events.  A plugin is represented as a large JSON document.
<P>
Like other editors, you can add or remove global plugins from the 
Global Options/Plugins menu, or plugins that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Plugins menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Plugin editor allows you to either load a new
plugin from your local filesystem, paste one into the text areas, or delete an existing 
one from the list.  The first text area is for the plugin JSON definition, while
the second text area is for the plugin JavaScript handling code.
Consult the <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a>
help for the proper syntax of the add plugin and javascript text areas.
<P>
When entering a plugin definition or the javascript code by hand, the appropriate 
text area will turn red and stay red until the document meets minimal requirements, 
or if it has any errors.  When one of the 
text areas is red, you can hover over the little ? help button to the left of it to
see the specific problem, or click on the help button to pull up the full help file.
